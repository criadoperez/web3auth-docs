Web3Auth's SDKs are fully compatible with all EVM-based chains, following the specifications
outlined in EIP155 and EIP 1193. EIP 155 defines the standard for transaction replay protection,
enhancing security measures for authenticating users across various platforms. EIP 1193, on the
other hand, outlines the standard EVM API, enabling developers to interact with EVM blockchains
efficiently.

Hence for all compatible chains, the standard interface allows you to seamlessly integrate any
supported blockchain by just passing in the correct parameters like Chain ID, RPC Target URL etc.

We have documented some of the famous EVM Compatible Chains here.
