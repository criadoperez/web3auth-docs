title: Initialize Web3Auth
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Web3Auth needs to be initialized as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in.
Preferably done within a constructor, initialization is the step where you can pass on all the
configurations for Web3Auth you want.

For initializing Web3Auth PnP No Modal SDK, you need to provide your Client ID, the Web3Auth Network
of your project and the configuration of the chain you're looking to connect to.
