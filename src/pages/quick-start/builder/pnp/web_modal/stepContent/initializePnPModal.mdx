title: Initialize Web3Auth
---

Web3Auth needs to be initialized as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in.
Preferably done within a constructor, initialization is the step where you can pass on all the
configurations for Web3Auth you want.

For initializing Web3Auth PnP Modal SDK, you need to provide your Client ID, the Web3Auth Network of
your project and the configuration of the chain you're looking to connect to.
