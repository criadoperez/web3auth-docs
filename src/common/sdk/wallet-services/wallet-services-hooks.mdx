Web3Auth provides essential React hooks for the Wallet Services Plugin SDK for managing wallet
services such as WalletConnect, TopUp, and Wallet UI. These hooks can be directly imported from the
`@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks` package. Here's an example of how to import them:

```jsx
import { useWalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks";
```

For more information on React hooks, refer to the
[official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

### Available Hooks

- `useWalletServicesPlugin`: Provides access to the Wallet Services Plugin context initialized via
  the `WalletServicesProvider` component.

### Web3AuthProvider

The `Web3AuthProvider` component wraps the main component and injects the Web3Auth-related context
into it. For more details on the `Web3AuthProvider`, please refer to the
[Web3AuthProvider documentation](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/modal-hooks#web3authprovider).
